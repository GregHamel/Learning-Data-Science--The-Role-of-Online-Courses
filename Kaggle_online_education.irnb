      "source": "Back in 2011, if you wanted to learn online, your options were limited. You could scour the internet for articles, blog posts, forums and the occasional video to piece together understanding of a topic of interest, but structured online courses could only really be found on MIT's [OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) platform. Although MIT OCW offered a massive repository of course materials recorded from live lectures, its content was not optimized for the web. Content was uploaded en masse and “as is”, leaving users to sift through mountains of material, without a consistent structure, that often lacked key course components.\n\nThis was the learning landscape I entered when I took my first online course. I had several friends in college who were into computer science, but I didn't know anything about it myself, so I decided to try to learn the basics of programming online. Eventually, I stumbled upon an MIT OCW course called [MIT 6.0: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm). I had never used OCW before and certainly had never heard of Python, but it seemed like as good a place to start as any. After all, it was just an intro course and with MIT's expert educators on my side how hard could it be?\n\nIt was hard. The lectures were long and there was no interactivity. The concepts made sense, but there wasn't an easy way to quickly put them into practice. The first programming assignment that required a relatively trivial calculation had me pulling out my hair, on the verge of quitting. Later I discovered that the solution required a for loop, a construction that was covered in a teacher's assistant session that was seperate from the main lectures. It was a struggle, but I learned a lot. I learned the basics of Python, but also that an archive of on campus content was not an ideal format for online education. It was the Web 1.0 of online learning. But Web 2.0 was coming fast.\n\nIn the first half of 2012, three new platforms for massive open online courses, also known as “MOOCs”, appeared: [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [edX](https://www.edx.org/). With them came an explosion of new learning content that was more accessible and interactive than ever before, often created in partnership with top universities, all available for free. I started taking courses on all three platforms and also began writing reviews of the courses I took to help other learners decide which courses to take. In 2014, I took the first offering of MIT's [The Analytics Edge](https://www.edx.org/course/the-analytics-edge) on edX, which taught the basics of R and also introduced Kaggle, which was used as a platform to administer the final project. Since then, I've taken over 100 MOOCs, written over [100 course reviews](https://www.coursetalk.com/accounts/profile/greghamel) and participated in dozens more Kaggle competitions.\n\nThe 2018 Kaggle Machine Learning survey challenge presents an opportunity to for you to join me in exploring the intersection of two of my greatest interests: online courses and Kaggle. In particular, we will explore the role machine learning MOOCs have played in the data science education of Kagglers. Do most Kagglers learn from MOOCs? Which MOOC platforms do Kagglers use most? How do Kagglers perceive the quality of online courses versus traditional education? In this inquiry we will take a deep dive into MOOC usage by the Kaggle community, answering all of these questions and more. Along the way, I will provide my insights as a prolific MOOC-taker and explore how reality aligns with--or defies--my expectations.\n"

The responses to each category are numeric values indicating the percentage that each source contributed to a user's overall data science education.\n\n<br>\n\n*Note: Throughout our exploration I will use the terms \"online courses\" and \"MOOCs\" interchangeably,  the term \"Kagglers\" to refer to Kaggle users, the term \"MOOCers\" to refer to those who take online courses and the term \"non-MOOCers\" to refer to those who do not take online courses. I will treat the Kaggle survey data as representative of the Kaggle community as a whole and thus \"Kagglers\" will refer both to all Kaggle users and all survey respondents.*\n\n<br>\n\n## Learning Source Participation  <a id=\"section1aa\"></a>\n<br>\n\nWe will begin our exploration by investigating which learning sources Kagglers participate in most often. We'll consider any learning source with a non-zero value for survey question 35 to be a source that a user participates in.\n\nLet's start by creating a plot to check the number of Kagglers that use each learning source. Each time we make a plot, I will note my main expectation of what we will find ahead of time based on my knowledge of Kaggle and online learning and then contrast my expectation against the reality of our observations.\n\n#### Expectation:\n* Kaggle will be the most frequently used learning source, since this is a survey of Kaggle users."

Let's summarize our key findings thus far:\n\n*  Self-teaching is the most common learning method among Kagglers. \n* About 70% of Kagglers use MOOCs and MOOC use is relatively consistent across gender and age.\n* MOOCers tend to use many different learning sources, while non-MOOCers tend to use a smaller number of learning sources more heavily.\n* The biggest demographic differences in MOOC usage we discovered was variation across countries. This suggests country-related factors such as income, language and access to traditional education may play an important role in MOOC participation.\n\n"

In this section, we will explore which MOOC platforms Kagglers use. Specifically, we will look at survey questions 36 and 37, which read: \"Which (MOOC) platforms have you used?\" and \"On which platforms have you spent the most time?\" respectively.\n\nFrom my personal experience, I know that Coursera is both one of the oldest MOOC platforms and has the largest catalog of free university-style courses of any platform. It was also the first platform I'm aware of that offered data science courses taught by industry experts such as Andrew Ng's [machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and Geoffrey Hinton's (now retired) course \"Neural Networks for Machine Learning\" which were both available in 2012. Consequently, I expect Coursera to lead in terms of overall MOOC platform popularity, with the other long-running platforms edX and Udacity rounding out the top three. I have used many other platforms in the past, including [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and Kaggle's learning materials, so it will be interesting to how these platforms stack up against the old guard.\n\n### MOOC Platform Participation <a id=\"section2a\"></a>\n\n<br>\n\nLet's begin our investigation of MOOC platforms by plotting the overall participation rate of each platform.\n\n#### Expectation:\n* Coursera will have the highest participation rate, followed by edX and Udacity."

      "source": "MOOCs have come a long way since I took my first programming course on OpenCourseWare. As the accessibility of machine learning MOOCs has grown, they've established themselves as a staple learning source among the data science community, used by over 70% of Kagglers. Coursera is a dominant force in the MOOC market, with more than twice as many users on Kaggle than any other platform, but many MOOCers use multiple platforms. Kagglers also generally have positive perceptions of the quality of MOOCs versus traditional brick and mortar institutions, which is good news for online course providers as they seek to find sustainable business models that strike the right balance between free and paid content.\n\nOnline courses let you learn wherever you are, at your own pace, to fulfill your personal learning goals. They democratize education in an unprecedented way, allowing anyone with interest and internet access to take courses taught by top universities and industry experts. My hope is that our exploration of MOOC usage on Kaggle has given you new insights into the role of online courses in data science education and piqued your curiosity to try a new course, explore a new platform or perhaps to take a MOOC for the first time. There's little to lose and a lot to learn!\n"
